# üîè Introduction

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/CBSecurity-S-darkbg.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>The Best Way To Secure Your Applications</p></figcaption></figure>

The ColdBox `cbsecurity` module is a collection of modules to help secure your ColdBox applications.

The major areas of concern are:

* A **security authentication/authorization firewall** ( `cbsecurity` ) which can secure your application based on:
  * Security rules and a rule engine for validation of incoming events or URL patterns
  * Handler annotations
* Security **** service for explicit authorizations ( `cbsecurity` ) to provide you with functional approaches to security context authorization in **any** layer of your application.
* A **JWT generator, decoder, and authentication services** ( `jwtcfml` )&#x20;
* Cross-Site Request Forgery **(CSRF) Protection** ( `cbcsrf` )
* An **authentication manage**r ( `cbauth` ) which can be plug-and-play with your own or third-party modules
* Basic Authentication services that provide basic user credential storage and browser challenges
* A graphical user interface for visualizing the firewall and operational settings we lovingly call the **CBSecurity Visualizer**
* Industry-standard response headers to protect against XSS, clickjacking, frame busting, and much more
* Generate secure and random passwords

## Module composition

## Features

* Ability to have global security rules
* The ability for modules to add their own security rules and action overrides
* Ability to distinguish between authentication and authorization issues
* Annotation-driven cascading security for handlers and actions
* A functional security service that can be injected anywhere to provide you with authorizations
* Security rules can exist in:
  * XML File
  * JSON File
  * Database
  * Models
* The rules can be configured to use regular expressions or simple snippets
* You can use ColdFusion authentication security
* Can leverage any custom authentication provider
* Plug any Authentication service or can leverage [cbauth](https://github.com/elpete/cbauth) by default
* Ability to distinguish between invalid authentication and authorization and determine the process's outcome. &#x20;
* Ability to load/unload security rules from contributing modules.
* The ability for each module to define its own `validator`
* JWT Access and Refresh Tokens Native support
