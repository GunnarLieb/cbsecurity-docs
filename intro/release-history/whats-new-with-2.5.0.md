# What's New With 2.5.0

In this release we have updated our internal authentication library `cbauth` to version 5.x.  Which brings the following changes to `cbauth`:

* Added preLogin, postLogin, preLogout, postLogout interception points
* `authentication()` now returns the user if valid

Just run `update cbsecurity` and you are done!
